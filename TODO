* TODO in-accord and partial measures

If notes in a measure run in parallel it is the choice of the
transcriber what to do, options are:
 * use intervals: This is concise but might make it less obvious how
   several voices run individually.  In a 3 voice measure (treble clef) you'd
   always need to read the top note and both intervals to know what the
   bottom note is.
 * use in-accord separators (full-measure and part-measure): This can make
   several voices pretty clear, but usually results in more cells being used.

Considerations: It really depends on the music if intervals
or in-accord separators should be used.  It might be a good idea
to have a interval-cancel feature which would allow the user
to select a chord and request it not being written with interval notation.

Additionally, the use of part-measure in-accord can further
complicate things.  There is almost always the choice of using
only full-measure in-accord, however, what is more readable
is really hard to tell programmatically (at least I think so for now).
Also, there seem to be cases where part-measure in-accord is
necessary to convey what happens (full-measure in accord wouldn't work, see below).

This said, MusicXML has also several ways to convey identical
structure.  Either <chord/> is used to combine notes (this
is really just syntactic sugar for manipulating the tick) or <backup> is used
to write the notes in several sweeps from left to right.  However, visually,
there is no difference, so ideally, FreeDots would not care how the original
MusicXML is specified.  Chords should be detected as such also if <chord/>
is not used but notes appears to be parallel.  It should
be a setting at transcription time that tells the system if
intervals are allowed and if full-measure in-accord only, or in-accord in
general is supposed to be used.

We need to find an intermediate representation that allows for
easy querying of structure such that parallel notes and partial
voices can be handled.  In 4/4 time, imagine a measure
that starts with a quarter c, but continues with a dotted half
b and d.  This is part-measure in accord, and would be written
as qc>hb,hd (> terminates a partial measure and , separates partial-measure
in-accord).

To top if off, it would be desireable to design the transcription
phase such that all possible transcriptions of a measure (given
the restrictions specified by the user) are generated and the
best (shortest) version is used.  However, this could lead
to strange transcriptions if the method can vary from measure to measure,
so set up in the hierarchy and make the decision based
on scoring all measures.  But this will not work with
music that changes a lot, which is probably the default, so...
