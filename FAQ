Frequently asked questions:
---------------------------

Q: Why can't I read the default output of FreeDots on Linux with BRLTTY?
A: FreeDots uses Unicode by default to output Braille and Text such that
   sighted and blind users can read the output without major confusion.
   However, the Unicode braille row is only supported by the braille display
   driver BRLTTY on Linux since version 3.10.
   You will also need the braille fonts provided
   on http://brl.thefreecats.org/

Q: Why can't I read the default output of FreeDots on Windows with JAWS?
A: JAWS apparently does not define the Braille Unicode row by default,
   see the file README.JAWS for instructions on how to fix this.

Q: Does FreeDots work on Windows:
A: Yes.  Earlier versions of FreeDots did only work in batch-processing mode
   on Microsoft Windows.  The new rewritten in Java does now allow for
   cross-platform GUI accessibility.  As with all Java platform applications
   on Microsoft Windows, you will have to have the Java-Access-Bridge
   installed on your computer.

Q: How do I convert the output of FreeDots to BRF?
A: Write the output of FreeDots to a file, edit it in a UTF-8 compatible
   text editor and remove the text heading (score title, composer and so on).
   Save the file and use iconv like this:
    $ iconv -f UTF-8 -t BRF filename >filename.brf
   Please note this is only a temporary workaround, support for output
   in various localized braille encodings will be added in the future
   (patches welcome).  This is easy to do, but has a low priority at the
   moment.
