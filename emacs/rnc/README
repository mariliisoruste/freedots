MusicXML Relax NG schemas
-------------------------

The musicxml-rng distribution contains the original MusicXML 2.0 DTDs
from Recordare LLC[1] converted to Relax NG[2] (compact) format.

This is mostly to allow validation and completion of MusicXML documents
edited in Emacs nxml-mode.

nxml-mode integration:
----------------------
To make nxml-mode automatically load the correct MusicXML schema
file when visiting a MusicXML document put the following in your ~/.emacs file:

 (require 'rng-loc)
 (add-to-list 'rng-schema-locating-files
 	      (expand-file-name "/path/to/musicxml-rng/schemas.xml"))

Or alternatively use the Emacs customization interface:

 1. Type "M-x customize-varilable RET rng-schema-locating-files RET".
 2. Add the schemas.xml file from the directory where you unpacked the
 musicxml-rng distribution to the list of locating-files.
 3. Select "Save for future sessions" to make this change permanent.

This should make nxml-mode automatically detect and load the correct
MusicXML schema if you open a MusicXML document in nxml-mode.
