# An opus collects MusicXML scores together into a larger
# entity. The individual scores could be movements in a
# symphony, scenes or acts in an opera, or songs in an
# album. The opus definition allows arbitrary nesting
# either via an opus (included in the document) or an
# opus-link (linked like scores). Future versions of the
# MusicXML format may expand this DTD to include reference
# data and other metadata related to musical scores.

# Component DTD modules

# The common DTD module contains the entities and elements
# that are shared among multiple DTD modules.

include "common.mod.rnc"
# The link DTD module contains XLink attributes.
include "link.mod.rnc"
# Elements

# Opus is the document element. The document-attributes
# entity includes the version attribute and is defined in
# the common.mod file.
opus =
  element opus { attlist-opus, title?, (opus | opus-link | score)* }
attlist-opus &= document-attributes
# The score elements provide the links to the individual 
# movements. The new-page attribute, added in Version
# 2.0, is used to indicate if the first page of the score is 
# different than the last page of the previous score. If
# new-page is "yes", then a different page is used; if
# "no", then the same page is used. The default value is
# implementation-dependent.
score = element score { attlist-score, empty }
attlist-score &=
  link-attributes,
  attribute new-page { yes-no }?
# An opus-link provides a link to another opus document,
# allowing for multiple levels of opus collections via
# linking as well as nesting.
opus-link = element opus-link { attlist-opus-link, empty }
attlist-opus-link &= link-attributes
# Future versions may include metadata elements. In
# this version, we just include the title of the opus.
