Emacs support code for MusicXML and Braille Music Notation
----------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains an Emacs-Lisp implementation of MusicXML
and Braille Music Notation support code.  It is not a complete
braille music transcription system.  It was originally written
as an experimental platform for trying various approaches to
MusicXML processing and Braille Music representation/transcription.

While it is not complete and currently not actively developed, there
is probably enough code already to be useful in a few special situations.
For instance, MusicXML to MIDI export is something people might
be interested in.

The biggest showstopper in this experiment was/is performance.  As a result
of various optimisation attempts, a patch was committed to GNU Emacs
in fall 2008 which enhanced XML parsing performance by roughly 30%.  However,
this speedup is still not enough for comfortable load times when it
comes to big MusicXML scores.
