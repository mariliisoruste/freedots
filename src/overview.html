<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation">Musical notation</a> to
<a href="http://www.brl.org/music/">braille music</a> transcription framework.
<p>
The main entry point for program execution is class {@link freedots.Main}.
Command-line options are parsed and stored in class {@link freedots.Options}.
<h2>Non-interactive use</h2>
The program can be run in batch-mode from the command-line to transcribe
input data to braille music or convert the given score to MIDI.
<p>
If no graphical environment is available the program will automatically
fall back to non-interactive command-line mode.  Otherwise,
the command-line option "-nw" (no window) can be used to disable startup of
the graphical user interface.
<h2>Graphical user interface</h2>
By default, the program will start a GUI to present the transcription
results and allow for a few interactive features.
Classes for the GUI which are toolkit independant can be found
in {@link freedots.gui}.  The Swing based implementation is located in
package {@link freedots.gui.swing}.
<h2>Input file format</h2>
Currently, the only format supported is MusicXML, therefore a lot of
things are tailored towards this format.  However, to fasciliate
separation between various potential file formats, a library
of format agnostic classes for music notation representation is
located in package {@link freedots.music}.
<h3>MusicXML</h3>
MusicXML handling is implemented in package {@link freedots.musicxml}.
The main entry point into this package is class {@link freedots.musicxml.Score}.
<h2>Transcription to braille music notation</h2>
All the classes related to braille transcription are grouped together
in package {@link freedots.transcription}.  Class
{@link freedots.transcription.Transcriber} is responsible for transcribing a
given {@link freedots.musicxml.Score} object to braille music notation.
<h2>Conversion to MIDI</h2>
Package {@link freedots.playback} provides a few classes to fascilitate
interactive MIDI playback.
{@link freedots.musicxml.MIDISequence} is used to convert a
{@link freedots.musicxml.Score} object to a format suitable for
playback using the Java Sound API.
